# Churn_problem
Project is a part of the course Deep Learning School from MIPT. 
The code solves a machine learning problem of predicting customer churn for a telecom company. The code includes data cleaning such as removing duplicates 
and filling missing values. It then explores the data using visualizations and prepares the data for training the model by encoding categorical features 
and scaling numerical features.

The code trains a logistic regression model and a CatBoost classifier model to predict customer churn.
It uses grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the models. Finally, the code makes predictions on a test dataset and generates a submission file.
The evaluation metric used is ROC-AUC score, and the code calculates it for the training and validation sets.
